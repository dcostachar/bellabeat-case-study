# Project Overview 

**This case study analyzes Fitbit Fitness Tracker data to develop a data-driven marketing strategy for Bellabeat, a leading manufacturer of health-focused smart devices for women.**

Using the six-step data analysis process—**Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act**—I leveraged **R** and the **tidyverse ecosystem (including `readr`, `dplyr`, and `tidyr`)** to clean, process, and analyze complex datasets. The analysis included competitor research and provided insights into key user behaviours such as activity levels, sleep quality, energy expenditure, and device usage trends.

With **ggplot2**, I created data visualizations to communicate my findings and proposed actionable recommendations, including **targeted advertising campaigns, in-app engagement strategies,** and **product feature enhancements.** These initiatives aim to increase customer engagement, strengthen Bellabeat's market position, and drive its business growth in the smart device market.
