## Bellabeat Case Study: How Can a Wellness Technology Company Play It Smart?

This case study presents a comprehensive analysis of Fitbit Fitness Tracker user data to develop a data-driven marketing strategy for Bellabeat, a leading manufacturer of health-focused smart products for women. Employing the six-step data analysis process—Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act—I utilized R and the tidyverse ecosystem (including readr, dplyr, and tidyr) to clean, process, and analyze complex datasets, uncovering insights into user behaviour, including activity levels, sleep quality, energy expenditure, and device usage trends. Leveraging ggplot2, I created compelling data visualizations to effectively communicate findings and formulated actionable, data-backed marketing recommendations, including targeted ad campaigns, in-app engagement strategies, and product feature enhancements. These strategic marketing initiatives are designed to boost customer engagement, strengthen Bellabeat's market position, and drive business growth in the competitive smart device market.
